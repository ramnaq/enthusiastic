# Enthusiastic: learning different languages and paradigms from zero

## Source

Similar and simple programming problems solved in different languages. The
problems here are from Programming Paradigms course (Computer Science -
[Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://www.ufsc.br)).

Every directory has a `questions.pdf` file, which was provided by the
professor, and each `problem<i>.<ext>` (e.g
[`problem13.hs`](haskell/lists/problem13.hs) or
[`problem10.lsp`](lisp/lists/problem10.lsp)) corresponds to the 'i' question of
that file.

* All files are available only in portuguese, but english versions will be
  released.
* All code was written learning the languages from zero, except
  [python](python/).

## Student
No diretório [student](student) há os slides usados durante o curso, os quais
proveem a teoria básica necessária para resolver os problemas em "Source"
(código de todos os outros diretórios). Há também os dois "relatórios" sobre
[paradigmas de programação](student/atividade1-paradigmas.pdf) e [Orientação
a Objetos em Python](student/python/atividade2-python.pdf), e
[exercícios](student/calc-lambda-exercicios.pdf) sobre cálculo lambda, cuja
teoria é explicada em [calculo-lambda.pdf](student/calculo-lambda.pdf).
_____
In the [student](student) directory there are the slides of the lectures, which
approaches the basics that is needed to solve the problems in "Source" (code
contained in the other directories).

All the content is available only in portuguese, and is authored by the
professor, Maicon Zatelli (except
[`atividade1-paradigmas.pdf`](student/atividade1-paradigmas.pdf) and
[`atividade2-python.pdf`](student/python/atividade2-python.pdf), which were
homeworks).
