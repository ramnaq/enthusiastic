# Enthusiastic: learning different languages and paradigms from zero

Similar and simple programming problems solved in different languages. The
problems here are from the Programming Paradigms course (Computer Science -
[Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](ufsc.br)). Every directory has
a `questions.pdf` file, which was provided by the professor, and each `problem<i>.<ext>` (e.g [`problem13.hs`](haskell/listas/problem13.hs) or [`problem10.lsp`](lisp/listas/problem10.lsp)) corresponds to the 'i' question of that file.

* All files are available only in portuguese, but english versions will be released.
* All code was written learning the languages from zero, except [python](python/).
